\arguments{
\item{simulation_name}{A character string with the name of the simulation directory to be created.}

\item{population_name}{A character string with the name of the population directory to be used.}

\item{starting_year}{A numeric indicating the year in which the simulation starts.}

\item{number_of_years}{A numeric indicating the duration of the simulation in years.}

\item{population_size}{A Numeric indicating the size of the population to simulate.}

\item{ref_scenario_name}{A character string with the name of the reference scenario.}

\item{has_newborns}{A logical for whether to include newborns in the simulation.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{min_age}{A numeric indicating the minimum age for the population (0-95). Default is 0.}

\item{max_age}{A numeric indicating the maximum age for the population (0-95). Default is 95.}

\item{time_step}{A numeric indicating the time step for the simulation. Must be 1.}

\item{result_type}{The type of results to generate. Can be \code{NULL} or a character string.}

\item{random_seed}{An optional seed for random number generation.}

\item{scenarios}{A list of scenario configurations. Each scenario must be a list containing:
\itemize{
\item uniquename: A character string which uniquely identifies the scenario
\item successRate: A numeric which specifies the success rate between 0 and 100
\item targetMinAge: A numeric which sets the minimum target age (0-95)
\item targetMaxAge: A numeric which sets the maximum target age (0-95)
\item targetSex: A numeric which indicates the target sex code (0: male; 1: female; 2: both)
\item transfilename: A character string which specifies the transition filename
\item prevfilename: A character string which specifies the prevalence filename
}}

\item{diseases}{A list of disease configurations. Each disease must be a list containing:
\itemize{
\item uniquename: A character string which uniquely identifies the disease
\item prevfilename: A character string which specifies the prevalence filename
\item incfilename: A character string which specifies the incidence filename
\item excessmortfilename: A character string which specifies the excess mortality filename
\item dalyweightsfilename: A character string which specifies the disability weights filename
}}

\item{risk_factors}{A list containing a single risk factor configuration with:
\itemize{
\item uniquename: A character string which uniquely identifies the risk factor
\item transfilename: A character string which specifies the transition filename
\item prevfilename: A character string which specifies the prevalence filename
}}

\item{relative_risks}{A list of relative risk configurations. Each relative risk must be a list
containing:
\itemize{
\item RRindex: A character string which identifies the relative risk relationship
\item isRRfrom: A character string which specifies the source. Must be the name of a
disease or risk factor
\item isRRto: A character string which specifies the target identifier. Must be the name of a
disease or risk factor
\item isRRFile: A character string which specifies the relative risk file path
}}
}
\value{
Logical TRUE if directory creation and configuration was successful.
}
\description{
Creates a new directory for a simulation and generates a configuration XML file.
The configuration is read by the DYNAMO-HIA model to run the configured simulation. Simulation
results will be stored in the same directory.
}
\details{
The function creates a directory with the specified simulation name and generates
a \code{configuration.xml} file inside it using the provided parameters.
}
