## Installation

You can install the development version of hiaR via `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github("rivm-syso/hiaR")
```

## Running the app

You can start the app with `launch_application`:
```r
launch_application()
```

## Example

## Development documentation

Make sure you have the right settings for line endings.

**In RStudio**
- Open `Tools` -> `Project Options` -> `Code Editing`
- Tick `Ensure that source files end with newline`
- Set `Line ending conversions to Windows (CR/LF)` 

**In the console**
- run `usethis::use_rstudio(line_ending = "windows")`

### Conventions

#### Naming of modules

If R shiny modules are developed, use the following naming pattern
- the R script with the module is called "my_purpose_module.R"
- inside `my_purpose_module.R`, define the functions `my_purpose_ui` for the user
interface and `my_purpose_server` for the server
- If possible, add automatic tests for the server functionality. The UI functionality is 
more complex to test and we decided to test this manually for now.

#### Imports

Any functions from `shiny` can be used directly without the `shiny::` prefix.
For any other packages, be explicit and use `mypackage::myfunction()`.
