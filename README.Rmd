# Dynamic Modeling of Health Impact Assessment in R

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of the `hiaR` R package is to provide a user-friendly interface to the DYNAMO-HIA software tool. It contains R functions to configure and run DYNAMO-HIA, and to visualize the results. The package also contains a Shiny app to interactively run DYNAMO-HIA.

DYNAMO-HIA (DYNamic MOdeling for Health Impact Assessment) is
a generic software tool specially designed to aid the quantification
step in health impact assessment. DYNAMO-HIA is generic in the sense
that it allows arbitrary chronic diseases or risk-factors that fit the
standard causal pathway of the health impact assessment framework to
be modeled. The user can import and use his or her own data to add and
analyze diseases or populations that are of interest to him or her.

## Getting Started
### Running the Shiny App

You can start the Shiny app with `hiaR::launch_application`:
```r
hiaR::launch_application()
```

### Running DYNAMO-HIA from R

You can run DYNAMO-HIA from R using the `hiaR::run_dynamo_hia` function. This function requires a specific folder structure, reference data, and simulation configuration file to be present. See the [`hiaR` documentation](https://dynamo-hia.github.io/hiaR/docs/articles/example.html) for a detailed example.

## Installation

You can install the `hiaR` package from GitHub via `remotes`:

```r
remotes::install_github("Dynamo-HIA/hiaR")
```

## User Documentation

The documentation of the `hiaR` package is available at [https://dynamo-hia.github.io/hiaR/](https://dynamo-hia.github.io/hiaR/).

The documentation of DYNAMO-HIA including the user manual, examples, and reference datasets is available at [https://dynamo-hia.github.io/](https://dynamo-hia.github.io/).

## Development Documentation

Make sure you have the right settings for line endings. If you open the project in RStudio, the settings are automatically set. Otherwise, you can set them manually:

**RStudio**

1. Open `Tools` $\rightarrow$ `Project Options` $\rightarrow$ `Code Editing`
2. Tick `Ensure that source files end with newline`
3. Set `Line ending conversions to Windows (CR/LF)` 

**Console**

- Run `usethis::use_rstudio(line_ending = "windows")`

On Windows, make sure that `git config core.autocrlf` is set to `false`.

### Conventions

We follow the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) style guide for R code. You can use the `styler` package to automatically format your code:

```r
# Style single R file (has tidyverse style as default)
styler::style_file("R/myfile.R")

# Apply style to entire package
styler::style_pkg()
```

#### Naming of Modules

For R Shiny modules, use the following naming pattern:

- The R file with the module should be named `my_purpose_module.R`
- Inside `my_purpose_module.R`, define the functions `my_purpose_ui` for the user interface and `my_purpose_server` for the server
- If possible, add automatic tests for the server functionality. The UI functionality is more complex to test and we decided to test this manually for now.

#### Imports

Any functions from `shiny` and `shinyFiles` can be used directly without the `shiny::` prefix.
For any other packages, be explicit and use `mypackage::myfunction()`.
