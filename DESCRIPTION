Description: DYNAMO-HIA (DYNamic MOdeling for Health Impact Assessment) is
    a generic software tool specially designed to aid the quantification
    step in health impact assessment. DYNAMO-HIA is generic in the sense
    that it allows arbitrary chronic diseases or risk-factors that fit the
    standard causal pathway of the health impact assessment framework to
    be modeled. The user can import and use his or her own data to add and
    analyze diseases or populations that are of interest to him or her.
