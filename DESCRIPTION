Description: The hiaR package provides a user-friendly interface to the DYNAMO-HIA software tool.
    It contains R functions to configure and run DYNAMO-HIA, and to visualize the results.
    The package also contains a Shiny app to interactively run DYNAMO-HIA.
    DYNAMO-HIA (DYNamic MOdeling
    for Health Impact Assessment) is a generic software tool
    specially designed to aid the quantification step in
    health impact assessment. DYNAMO-HIA is generic in the
    sense that it allows arbitrary chronic diseases or
    risk-factors that fit the standard causal pathway of the
    health impact assessment framework to be modeled. Users
    can import and use their own data to add and analyze
    diseases or populations of interest.
